#Summary
Lana is a favorite personal project of mine. It is a simple one page website with dynamic scrolling, heavy use of grid and flexbox, and a slideshow. The project is great becuase not only does it look dynamic but it also offers a simplistic look to site visitors. The website is optomized for mobile as well.

#Credits 
Credits go to [Swiperjs](https://swiperjs.com/) for providing quick implmentation of slideshow and [Fullpagejs](https://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/) for providing tquick implmentation of scroll feature.
